# National-Parks
This repo checks national park data and compares it gas and fuel prices. The goal is to use this data to predict the next years increase in park guests based off of the data. Visitation numbers are based off the end of the year where as fuel prices are based as of Jan 1 of the year.
This data also looks into two case studies, a national park the regularly recieves a large number of visitors (Yosemite) and one that recieves a much smaller number to get a better of idea on how this may work locally.
